We make A2X available as an affordable 14 day trial to provide everyone the opportunity to try our product and find out how it works for them. For today’s 14 day trial, you will be charged one payment of $2.95 for shipping and handling for this shipment. As a part of our continued commitment to you, we will send you a new supply of A2X approximately eighteen days after your initial order if you live in the US or Canada or twenty-one days if you live outside of the US or Canada, and then monthly shipments thereafter. You will receive the guaranteed price of $39.95 plus $9.95 shipping and handling per month, which will be conveniently charged to the credit card you provide today at the time of each shipment unless you call to cancel. We do not provide refunds for any charges after the trial period has expired. Notice of cancellation is required one day before the next scheduled shipment. There is no commitment and no minimum to buy. Exact shipment times may vary. For all inquiries, contact us at (877) 973-6339 or email us at support@a2xanxiety.com. We welcome all feedback regarding your body’s response to the 14 day trial. Please feel free to contact us and let us know how A2X is working for you.
